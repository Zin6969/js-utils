## ‚ö° Installation

As a **global utility**:

```
npm install -g @adamlui/scss-to-css
```

As a **dev dependency**, from your project root:

```
npm install -D @adamlui/scss-to-css
```

## üíª Usage

The basic **global command** is:

```
scss-to-css
```

Sample output:

**üí° Note:** Source maps are also generated.

#

To specify **input/output** paths:
   
```
scss-to-css <input_path> <output_path>
```

- `<input_path>`: Path to SCSS file or directory containing SCSS files to be compiled, relative to the current working directory. 
- `<output_path>`: Path to file or directory where CSS + sourcemap files will be stored, relative to original file location. (If not provided, `css/` is used.)

**üí° Note:** If folders are passed, files will be processed recursively. To include dot folders, pass `--include-dot-folders`.

#

To use as a **package script**, edit your project's `package.json` like this:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "<scss-to-css-cmd>"
  },
```

Replace `<scss-to-css-cmd>` with `scss-to-css` + optional args. Then, `npm run build:css` can be used to run the command.

## üìÉ Example commands:

- Compile all SCSS files in the **current directory** (outputs to `css/`):

   ```
   scss-to-css
   ```

- Compile all SCSS files in a **specific directory** (outputs to `path/to/your/directory/css/`):

   ```
   scss-to-css path/to/your/directory
   ```

- Compile a **specific file** (outputs to `path/to/your/css/file.min.css`):

   ```
   scss-to-css path/to/your/file.scss
   ```

- Specify both **input and output** directories (outputs to `output_folder/`):

   ```
   scss-to-css input_folder output_folder
   ```
