## ‚ö° Installation

As a **global utility**:

```

As a **dev dependency**, from your project root:

```

## üíª Usage

The basic **global command** is:

```
scss-to-css
```

Sample output:

To specify **input/output** directories:
   
```
scss-to-css <input_path> <output_path>
```

- `<input_path>`: Path to directory containing SCSS files to be compiled, relative to the current working directory. 
- `<output_path>`: Path to directory where CSS/sourcemap files will be stored, relative to original file location. (If not provided, same location is used.)

**üí° Note:** The paths can be either folders or specific files. If folders are passed, files will be processed recursively.<br><br>

To use as a **package script**, edit your project's `package.json` like this:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "<scss-to-css-cmd>"
  },
```

Replace `<scss-to-css-cmd>` with `scss-to-css` + optional args. Then, `npm run build:css` can be used to run the command.
